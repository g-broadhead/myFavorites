  <h2>About The Black Mages</h2>

  <p>
    The Black Mages were a Japanese instrumental rock band formed in 2002 by Nobuo Uematsu, Kenichiro Fukui and Tsuyoshi
    Sekito,<br>
    who were three video game composers for Square and Square Enix. The band arranged Uematsu's Final Fantasy video game
    series-based<br>
    compositions in a hard rock style often similar to progressive metal, achieved with the additional use of
    synthesizers.<br>
    A year later the band expanded to six members with the addition of Keiji Kawamori, Michio Okamiya and Arata
    Hanyuda.<br>
    In August 2010, Uematsu announced the band had been disbanded, but he would continue to perform rock arrangements of
    his music as a<br>
    part of another similar band, known as the Earthbound Papas. <br><br>

    The Black Mages did not tour as a band, but performed several concerts to promote their album releases. For their
    first album they<br>
    performed in Shibuya and Kanagawa, Japan in 2003 and later released a live video of the first concert on DVD
    exclusively to Uematsu<br>
    fanclub members. They repeated this for the release of their second album, performing in Kawasaki and Osaka, Japan
    in 2005 and<br>
    similarly released on DVD to fanclub members. The third album saw a performance in Yokohama, Japan in 2008;<br>
    a DVD of the show was released commercially in March 2009. In addition to these concerts, The Black Mages made live
    appearances at two<br>
    Final Fantasy concerts, More Friends: Music from Final Fantasy and Voices - Music from Final Fantasy, as well as
    another video game<br>
    music event, Extra: Hyper Game Music Event 2007.
