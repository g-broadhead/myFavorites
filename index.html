  <h2>About The Black Mages</h2>

    <p>
      The Black Mages were a Japanese instrumental rock band formed in 2002 by Nobuo Uematsu, Kenichiro Fukui and Tsuyoshi
      Sekito, who were three video game composers for Square and Square Enix. The band arranged Uematsu's Final Fantasy video game
      series-based compositions in a hard rock style often similar to progressive metal, achieved with the additional use of
      synthesizers. A year later the band expanded to six members with the addition of Keiji Kawamori, Michio Okamiya and Arata
      Hanyuda. In August 2010, Uematsu announced the band had been disbanded, but he would continue to perform rock arrangements of
      his music as a part of another similar band, known as the Earthbound Papas. 
      
      <br><br>

      The Black Mages did not tour as a band, but performed several concerts to promote their album releases. For their
      first album they performed in Shibuya and Kanagawa, Japan in 2003 and later released a live video of the first concert on DVD
      exclusively to Uematsu fanclub members. They repeated this for the release of their second album, performing in Kawasaki 
      and Osaka, Japan in 2005 and similarly released on DVD to fanclub members. The third album saw a performance in Yokohama, 
      Japan in 2008; a DVD of the show was released commercially in March 2009. In addition to these concerts, The Black Mages made live
      appearances at two Final Fantasy concerts, More Friends: Music from Final Fantasy and Voices - Music from Final Fantasy, 
      as well as another video game music event, Extra: Hyper Game Music Event 2007.
